My zsh configs. If you don't know what's what, you probably shouldn't use it
but get your own going. Feel free though :)

Interesting keybindings:

    editing:
        ^F edit command line in $EDITOR
        ^H run help for current $0
        ^P push line on stack
        ^O insert line from stack
        ^T undo
        ^R prepend "sudo "
        ctrl-left/right will move along argument boundaries
        repeated ... will be turned into ../.. (mikachu's rationalise-dots)

    history:
        down on empty line will clear the line but add it to history, irssi-style 
        up will search history on first word match
        ctrl-up/down will substring-search history

    functional shortcuts:
        ^L display ls
        ^X^L clear screen (instead of ^L)
        ^Z do "fg %%" (allows neat toggling)

    in menu-complete:
        page-up will accept and complete again (go into directory)
        page-down will undo (basically, go up directory)
        menu will accept selection but stay in menu-complete

Tidbits:
 - on urxvt, the cursor will become red when in vi normal mode
 - the hostname color in the prompt is generated from a hash

Caveats:
 - doesn't work well without 256 colors
 - doesn't work well for people who are not me
 - there are a couple remainders from omz (particularly in /lib), too lazy to
   get rid of those
